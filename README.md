Susam's Userscripts
===================

This repository contains some of my userscripts that I use while
browsing the web. These userscripts are tiny JavaScript snippets that
can be installed and run with a userscript manager such as
Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, or Tampermonkey. These userscript
managers are available as web browser extensions. One of them should
be installed on the web browser as a prerequisite before these
userscripts can be used.
