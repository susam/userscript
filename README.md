Susam's Userscripts
===================

This repository contains some of my userscripts that I use while
browsing the web. These userscripts are tiny JavaScript snippets that
can be installed and run with a userscript manager such as
Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, or Tampermonkey. These userscript
managers are available as web browser extensions. One of them should
be installed on the web browser as a prerequisite before these
userscripts can be used.

Here is a list of the available userscripts:

  * **BigHN**
    - Description: Increases font size and spacing on the Hacker News website.
    - Install: [bighn.user.js]

  * **DarkHN**
    - Description: Shows Hacker News using a dark color theme.
    - Install: [darkhn.user.js]

  * **Darken**
    - Description: Invert the color scheme of a web page to darken it
      on a best effort basis. Click four times quickly anywhere on a
      web page or type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> four times quickly to activate
      the inverted color scheme. Repeat to deactivate it.
    - Install: [darken.user.js]
